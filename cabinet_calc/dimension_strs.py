This module provides functions for converting floating point dimension
measurements into strings expressed in fractional inches, as are commonly used
by fabricators in a cabinet shop. The functions that produce fractional
dimension strings will produce 'strong' and 'shy' measurements, using the
suffixes '+' to mean strong and '-' to mean shy.

    The parameter `x' is a floating point value denoting the measurement of a
    dimension. The string representation of it that is returned is intended to
    be convenient for cutting in the shop. Some examples:

        `x'             Return Value

    Fractions are constrained to units of 1/n, where n is defined below, so
    results are reported to the nearest nth--i.e., if n equals 16, then results
    are reported to the nearest sixteenth. If x is not an exact number of nths,
