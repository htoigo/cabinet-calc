# Project file for Cabinet Calc program.

* Currently used version

** CabCalc-Spreadsheet

* Proof of Concept for new version
  See Google Keep card for drawings of interface and output.

** Interface
*** Isometric drawing of cabinet.
  Should the height, width, depth be entered next to this drawing?
*** Fields to enter numbers.
  Number of cabinets wanted.
  Height, Width, Depth as floats to 3 decimal places.
  Material Thickness, Bottom Thickness as floats to 3 decimal places.
  Material Type as a string.
*** Fields to enter Notes.
**** Notes for overall piece.
**** Notes for each individual part.

** Output
  There is an example of a more complex output from CAD on Google Drive.  This
  type takes a lot of work, and while they use CAD program to generate PDF
  output like this for standard catalog items that they make a lot of, they want
  to avoid this for one-off items.  Hence this program.
*** Terminal Job Description
  Pared-down description of the job, with no diagrams. Just the information. What
  must we include, here?
*** Pretty Job Description, first page
Should contain the most critical information for the job.
**** Isometric drawing of cabinet
**** Parts List
***** Each part has:
**** Parts Images
***** Quantity
  E.g.: '7 Back Panels' in bottom left of part interior.
***** Width and height measurements labeled with arrows
***** Crosses mark sides to be banded
***** Material and thickness
  Printed in the interior of the part.

*** Pretty Job Description, second page
* Specification
  Identify true requirements. Ideally, limit to one page.

** Requirements
*** Must be runnable on Windows 10.
*** Generate a parts list with correct dimensions and number of each part.
*** Must be printable.
*** Must it be email-able?
** Use case #1
  Generate a cabinet-bank layout from:
    1. Wall width, height, depth, material, material thickness, number of
    fillers, 
* Implementation
** CabCalc main program
  Uses a collection of modules, which might be useful for other cabinet
  fabrication programs.
** Modules
*** gui
*** cabinet.py
  All cabinet-specific logic, independent of interface or output format or
  job description format.
**** Cabinet Bank
  Upper and/or lower cabinet run(s).
**** Cabinet Run
  Fullwidth, Height, Depth, Number of fillers, Doors per cabinet,
  Primary material, prim matl thickness, parts list,
*** job
  Complete job specification.
**** Job ID?
**** Name
**** Customer
**** List of Cabinet Banks
  Each Cabinet Bank has: Upper and/or lower cabinet runs.
**** Kiosks / Stations?
*** job output / cut sheet / parts sheet / job description
  Layout and generation of the pretty job description, independent of the final
  form--pdf, rtf, plain text, LaTeX, etc.
**** Job Title/Header
**** Cabinet (run) overview
  Includes primary material and material thickness.
  Whether open/closed on each end.
**** Parts list
  Do different parts need to specify their material & thickness?
  They could inherit material from Run primary material, if not specified for
  the part individually.
*** DONE  plain text
  Render the pretty job description to plain text, for output in the
  terminal.
*** pdf
  Render the pretty job description to PDF.
**** Isometric Drawing of a single cabinet
**** Parts Drawings
**** Cabinet Run Drawing
*** dxf
  Given a list of parts, arrange the parts on pieces of the raw material in the
  most efficient way possible, and generate a dxf file.
